Recap what we have learned. We will be creating a new route that has a lot of functionality that we have learned thus far from FastAPI :)


        Create a new route within the routers directory called users.py

        Enhance users.py to be able to return all users within the application

        Enhance users.py to be able to get a single user by a path parameter

        Enhance users.py to be able to get a single user by a query parameter

        Enhance users.py to be able to modify their current user's password, if passed by authentication

        Enhance users.py to be able to delete their own user.
